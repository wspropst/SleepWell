# SleepWell - Sleep Analysis Application

## Overview
This repository contains the work from an independent study undertaken during the fall 2023 semester at Chapman University. Led by Dr. Kurz and Dr. Springer, the project was a collaboration with student researcher Liam Propst. Initially focused on "Embedded Machine Learning (EML)", the study evolved into the development of "SleepWell", a smartwatch application designed to provide insights into the wearer's sleep patterns using Apple Watch sensors. Throughout the semester, several meetings were held to maintain guidelines and structure, ensuring the project remained focused and productive. This research represents an intersection of technology, health, and academic inquiry, contributing to the growing field of wearable technology in health monitoring.

## Repository Structure

- `/research`
  - Contains the general research document encompassing the study's findings and development insights.

- `/docs`
  - Includes notes from all research and meetings throughout the semester. These documents provide detailed insights into the project's progression, challenges, and milestones.

- `/SleepWell`
  - This directory houses the SleepWell watchOS application, developed using Swift and Xcode. The application is designed to monitor, analyze, and enhance sleep quality through advanced sensor data analysis.

- `/apple-watch-model`
  - A Python application for classifying sleep data using data obtained from Apple Watch sensors. This module represents the analytical backbone of the SleepWell application, employing machine learning techniques to interpret and classify sleep stages.

## Contributions
This project is the culmination of collaborative efforts between academia and student research. Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome to further the development and effectiveness of the SleepWell application.
