# SleepWell - Sleep Analysis Application

## Overview
This repository is the result of an independent study conducted during the fall 2023 semester, led by Dr. Kurz and Dr. Springer, with Liam Propst as the student undertaking the project. The project began with a focus on "Embedded Machine Learning (EML)" and evolved into the development of a smartwatch application, "SleepWell". The app aims to provide insights into the wearer's sleep by tracking various metrics using Apple Watch sensors.

## Repository Structure

- `/research`
  - Contains the general research document encompassing the study's findings and development insights.

- `/docs`
  - Includes notes from all research and meetings throughout the semester. These documents provide detailed insights into the project's progression, challenges, and milestones.

- `/SleepWell`
  - This directory houses the SleepWell watchOS application, developed using Swift and Xcode. The application is designed to monitor, analyze, and enhance sleep quality through advanced sensor data analysis.

- `/apple-watch-model`
  - A Python application for classifying sleep data using data obtained from Apple Watch sensors. This module represents the analytical backbone of the SleepWell application, employing machine learning techniques to interpret and classify sleep stages.

## Contributions
This project is the culmination of collaborative efforts between academia and student research. Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome to further the development and effectiveness of the SleepWell application.
